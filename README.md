# Another Processmanager

There are many reasons to start such a project while having a couple of alternatives 
which propably do the job better than this solution. But! I was not able to find a 
solution which fitted my needs. 

1. I wanted to have a solution which is running purly in Python3. 
2. I wanted a solution which has a xmlrpc interface
3. I wanted it to be lean and easy on resources

And of course, I love to learn new stuff :)
